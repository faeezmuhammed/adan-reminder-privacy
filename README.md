# Adan Reminder – Privacy Policy

**Effective date:** 17 Jan 2026

This Privacy Policy applies to **Adan Reminder** (package `com.bearfox.adanreminder`) and its Wear OS companion app (collectively, the “App”).

---

## Information we collect

### Location information
- Approximate location or precise location (if enabled by the user) is used solely to calculate prayer times and determine Qibla direction.
- Location data (such as latitude and longitude) may be stored locally on your device to support offline usage and avoid repeated permission requests.

### App data & preferences
- App settings and preferences (for example, prayer calculation method, offsets, and language).
- Prayer time data and Quran ayah content cached locally on the device for offline access.

### User-initiated content
- App-generated images created for sharing (such as a screenshot of prayer times) are stored locally only when you choose to share.

### Diagnostics
- Crash and diagnostic data may be collected only if Firebase Crashlytics is enabled, to help identify errors and improve app stability.

---

## How we use information

The collected information is used only to:
- Calculate prayer times and display Qibla direction.
- Schedule prayer alarms, notifications, and reminders.
- Sync prayer times and settings between the phone and Wear OS companion app.
- Maintain app settings and cached content for offline use.
- Diagnose crashes and improve performance and reliability.

---

## Sharing & third parties

We share data only when necessary to provide core app functionality:

- **Prayer time and Quran content APIs**
  - https://api.aladhan.com/v1/ (prayer times)
  - https://api.alquran.cloud/v1/ (Quran ayah content)

  Requests to these services may include parameters such as latitude and longitude for prayer time calculations.

- **Crash reporting**
  - If enabled, Firebase Crashlytics (a Google service) may receive crash and diagnostic data.

- **User-initiated sharing**
  - If you use the in-app share feature, the image you choose to share is sent to other apps you select through the Android share sheet.

The App does not include advertising SDKs and does not sell user data.  
If third-party services change in the future, this policy will be updated accordingly.

---

## Permissions & why we need them

The App may request the following permissions:

- `INTERNET` – Fetch prayer times and Quran content from external APIs.
- `ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION` / `ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION` – Determine location for prayer times and Qibla direction.
- `POST_NOTIFICATIONS` – Show prayer time reminders and notifications.
- `VIBRATE` – Provide vibration alerts for alarms and notifications.
- `SCHEDULE_EXACT_ALARM` / `USE_EXACT_ALARM` – Schedule precise prayer time alarms.
- `WAKE_LOCK` – Keep the device awake briefly for alarm playback.
- `USE_FULL_SCREEN_INTENT` – Display full-screen alarm UI when required.

### Wear OS companion permissions
- `INTERNET`, `WAKE_LOCK`, `VIBRATE`, `POST_NOTIFICATIONS` for alarm, notification, and sync functionality.

---

## Data retention

All app data (preferences, cached prayer times, and Quran content) is stored locally on your device.  
Data remains until you clear the app’s storage or uninstall the app.

No automatic server-side data retention is implemented by the App itself.

---

## Security

- All network communication uses secure HTTPS connections.
- Local data is stored using standard Android application storage mechanisms.
- Sensitive personal data is not intentionally stored by the App.

---

## User choices & data deletion

You can:
- Grant or revoke location and notification permissions at any time via Android system settings.
- Clear all locally stored data by clearing app storage or uninstalling the App.
- Choose whether or not to use the in-app sharing feature.

## Children’s privacy

This App is not specifically directed at children under the age of 13.  
We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If you believe a child has provided personal data, please contact us so we can take appropriate action.

---

## International data transfers

The App itself does not control the server locations of third-party API providers.  
Data may be processed in regions where those providers operate their infrastructure.

---
